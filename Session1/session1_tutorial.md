## **II. Tutorial**

### Goals:

- Installing QGIS
- Exploring the QGIS console

.

### Downloading QGIS

Visit https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html

Download the long-term release (most stable) version for your OS. This is a stable and relatively bug-free version as opposed to the latest release in which new features were introduced but you may find some bugs.

**MacOS:**

If you own an old Mac you may need to download an older version of QGIS. If you are unable to download 3.16, try downloading one of the 2.18 releases from [this page](https://qgis.org/downloads/macOS/)

**Windows users:** download the QGIS Standalone installer, you won't need the OSGeo4W setup for your usage.

Once the installer is downloaded and launched, you can follow the steps and use the default options offered in each step. You're then ready to start mapping!

### Documentation
The QGIS documentation is available at this address: https://qgis.org/en/docs/index.html

Please note:
1. This course is taught in English but some of you will have a version of QGIS installed that's in a different language. If you are trying to understand how a function translates into that language, at any time when navigating the documentation you can change the language of the page directly in the url (by replacing `/en/` by `/fr/` for French, or `/es/` for Spanish, `/zh-Hans/` for Mandarin Chinese etc.): For instance to go from English: `https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/`**en**`/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html` to French: `https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/`**fr**`/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html`

2. Similarly, you might have a version installed that is not 3.16 ; you can also edit the version directly in the URL to match the release you're using, by changing `/3.16/` . For instance from QGIS version 3.16 https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html to QGIS version 2.18 https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html
