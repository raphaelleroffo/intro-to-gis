### Setting up your QGIS project


### Loading data into your project


### Exporting data / Saving in a different format

Let's imagine you want to export data in GeoJSON to play with it in kepler.gl 

### Documentation
The QGIS documentation is available at this address: https://qgis.org/en/docs/index.html

Please note:
1. This course is taught in English but some of you will have a version of QGIS installed that's in a different language. If you are trying to understand how a function translates into that language, at any time when navigating the documentation you can change the language of the page directly in the url (by replacing `/en/` by `/fr/` for French, or `/es/` for Spanish, `/zh-Hans/` for Mandarin Chinese etc.): For instance to go from English: https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html to French: https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/fr/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html

2. Similarly, you might have a version installed that is not 3.16 ; you can also edit the version directly in the URL to match the release you're using, by changing `/3.16/` . For instance from QGIS version 3.16 https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html to QGIS version 2.18 https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html
