## **II. Tutorial**

### Goals:

- Downloading data from an open data portal
- Setting up a QGIS project 
- Loading data into QGIS
- Saving vector data to a different format

.

### Downloading data from the Barcelona open data portal

Today we'll look at the city of Barcelona and its green mobility infrastructure. Luckily, an open data portal is available for you to search for data. Go to https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset .

On the side panel, you can select the data formats you're interested in. Here, these could be SHP (shapefiles), GeoJSON and GPKG (geopackages). However there is a bug on the page as you can't select multiple formats at once ; if you select GeoJSON and SHP it will look for datasets that have both GeoJSON *and* SHP formats available. Instead, you have to do each format one by one. In this tutorial we'll stick to SHP as it's the most widely available format (23 datasets available) and in fact datasets available as GeoJSON are also available as SHP.

Now you see a list of various datasets. We will be interested in datasets related to cycling paths. Before you start downloading anything, make sure you create in your Documents a dedicated folder where you'll save all your downloads. You can call it `Session2`.


These are the datasets we will be working with:

- **Zones 30** (cars limited to 30km/h speed) https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/zones30-carrers 
  
  

  *If you scroll all the way down, you 'll see a set of information; this is your metadata. It tells you about the characteristics of this dataset:*

  **/!\ Now, BE VERY CAREFUL! On most platforms, downloading a shapefile will lead to a download of a zip file that contain 4 files:  `*.shp`, `*.dbs`, `*.shx` and `*.prj`. However, on this data portal it's not the case and chosing to download the `*.shp` file will only download that single file. Note that this file would be unusable on its own! So make sure you download the `*.zip` file and keep everything in that file.**
  
  *We'll actually download both the ZONES30-CARRERS Zip file, in which the Zone 30 streets are represented as lines, and the ZONES30-POLIGONS Zip file, where they're grouped in areas (polygons):*

- **Cycle paths** : https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/vies-ciclables
  
  *Download the 2021_2T zip file:*

- **Bike corridors** https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/corredors-bici-bcn
  
  *Download the zip file for T2.*

  *Note that when GeoJSON is available, you can preview the layer on a webmap:*

Now equipped with these 4 layers

### Setting up your QGIS project


### Loading data into your project


### Exporting data / Saving in a different format

Let's imagine you want to export data in GeoJSON to play with it in kepler.gl 

### Documentation
The QGIS documentation is available at this address: https://qgis.org/en/docs/index.html

Please note:
1. This course is taught in English but some of you will have a version of QGIS installed that's in a different language. If you are trying to understand how a function translates into that language, at any time when navigating the documentation you can change the language of the page directly in the url (by replacing `/en/` by `/fr/` for French, or `/es/` for Spanish, `/zh-Hans/` for Mandarin Chinese etc.): For instance to go from English: https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html to French: https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/fr/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html

2. Similarly, you might have a version installed that is not 3.16 ; you can also edit the version directly in the URL to match the release you're using, by changing `/3.16/` . For instance from QGIS version 3.16 https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html to QGIS version 2.18 https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html
