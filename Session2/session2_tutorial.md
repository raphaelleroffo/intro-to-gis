## **II. Tutorial**

### Goals:

- Downloading data from an open data portal
- Setting up a QGIS project 
- Loading data into QGIS
- Saving vector data to a different format

.

### 1. Downloading data from the Barcelona open data portal

Today we'll look at the city of Barcelona and its green mobility infrastructure. Luckily, an open data portal is available for you to search for data. Go to https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset .

On the side panel, you can select the data formats you're interested in. Here, these could be SHP (shapefiles), GeoJSON and GPKG (geopackages). However there is a bug on the page as you can't select multiple formats at once ; if you select GeoJSON and SHP it will look for datasets that have both GeoJSON *and* SHP formats available. Instead, you have to do each format one by one. In this tutorial we'll stick to SHP as it's the most widely available format (23 datasets available) and in fact datasets available as GeoJSON are also available as SHP.

Now you see a list of various datasets. We will be interested in datasets related to cycling paths. Before you start downloading anything, make sure you create in your Documents a dedicated folder where you'll save all your downloads. You can call it `Session2`. Note that QGIS can get "cranky" if the folder sits on a Dropbox or some kind of cloud-based drive. Please choose a *local* location on your computer.


These are the datasets we will be working with:

- **Zones 30** (cars limited to 30km/h speed) https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/zones30-carrers 
  
  

  *If you scroll all the way down, you 'll see a set of information; this is your metadata. It tells you about the characteristics of this dataset:*

  **/!\ Now, BE VERY CAREFUL! On most platforms, downloading a shapefile will lead to a download of a zip file that contain 4 files:  `*.shp`, `*.dbs`, `*.shx` and `*.prj`. However, on this data portal it's not the case and chosing to download the `*.shp` file will only download that single file. Note that this file would be unusable on its own! So make sure you download the `*.zip` file and keep everything in that file.**
  
  *We'll actually download both the 2021_2T_ZONES30_CARRERS Zip file, in which the Zone 30 streets are represented as lines, and the 2021_2T_ZONES30_POLIGONS Zip file, where they're grouped in areas (polygons):*

- **Cycle paths** : https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/vies-ciclables
  
  *Download the 2021_2T zip file:*

- **Bike corridors** https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/corredors-bici-bcn
  
  *Download the zip file for T2.*

  *Note that when GeoJSON is available, you can preview the layer on a webmap:*

Once all of these files are downloaded, make sure you **unzip everything** before you move on to the next step. QGIS does not understand zip files and is not able to unzip them for you.

Now equipped with these 4 unzipped layers in your `Session2` folder, you are ready to open QGIS!

### 2. Setting up your QGIS project

Start a new blank project.
In your browser panel, navigate to the location of your `Session2` folder. Because it's usually hidden in successive folders, I like to add the location as favourite.

<img src="../img/S2-07.png" width="700">

You can then rename the folder path to a simpler name such as "Intro Session 2". You can easily remove favourites from this right click menu.

<img src="../img/S2-08.png" width="700">

Next, and before you start doign anything else, save your project file. Navigate to your `Session2` folder and save the file using the default extension: `*.qgz`.

<img src="../img/S2-09.png" width="700">

<img src="../img/S2-10.png" width="700">



Now, here is a very important point: **A QGZ file alone does NOT contain any data! Rather, the QGZ file and every modification you make to it will save the way you process the data. When sharing a GIS project with another person, you need to make sure you also share the data with them. For instance if you've made a nice map with your cycling lanes and nice symbologies, you must share the QGZ and the cycling lane data together. Otherwise the person you send the QGZ to will open a blank document and will get an error message saying QGZ can't handle the layers.**
### 3. Loading data into your project

Now that you have set up your project nicely, time to load data.

From your `Intro - Session 2` folder in your **Browser** Favourites, unfold the folders and drag and drop all the layers (with the little blue symbol) onto your map canvas area.

<img src="../img/S2-11.png" width="700">

You will notice that four layers have now appeared in your **Layers** panel.

<img src="../img/S2-12.png" width="700">


By default, QGIS applies random colours to the layers.
Try drag and dropping layers to change their order in the Layers menu. By dragging the `Zone30_Polygons` layer to the bottom, I have now also moved that polygon layer under the three others on my map canvas.

<img src="../img/S2-13.png" width="700">

You can also play with unticking the layers to make them disappear from the canvas. By clicking on the eye icon you'll also be able to control the visibility of your layers. Note that to select multiple layers at once you can use Ctrl or Shift, just like in your regular file browser.

We will get back to symbology next week but for now, have a brief look at the attribute table of the polygon layer by right clicking on it and selecting the Attribute Table, or clicking the icon in your toolbar. You'll see a table appear, which contains the attribute data for your Zones 30 Areas.

More on that next week!

### 4. Exporting data / Saving in a different format

Let's imagine you want to export data in GeoJSON to play with it in kepler.gl 




### Reminder: QGIS Documentation
The QGIS documentation is available at this address: https://qgis.org/en/docs/index.html

Please note:
1. This course is taught in English but some of you will have a version of QGIS installed that's in a different language. If you are trying to understand how a function translates into that language, at any time when navigating the documentation you can change the language of the page directly in the url (by replacing `/en/` by `/fr/` for French, or `/es/` for Spanish, `/zh-Hans/` for Mandarin Chinese etc.): For instance to go from English: https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html to French: https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/fr/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html

2. Similarly, you might have a version installed that is not 3.16 ; you can also edit the version directly in the URL to match the release you're using, by changing `/3.16/` . For instance from QGIS version 3.16 https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html to QGIS version 2.18 https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html
