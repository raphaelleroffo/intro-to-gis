- Building a Choropleth
- Exporting a map: setting up a layout and adding map elements (north arrow, scale bar, legend, title etc.) 

.

In this tutorial, we will be exploring the theme of cycling to school. In the context of the Covid pandemic, the question of safely getting kids to attend school has become a key element in many countries' economic recovery strategies. Taking into considerations the pressing challenges of reducing carbon emissions, walking and cycling to school represent sustainable and safe ways for children and their parents to get to school, as long as proper cycling infrastructure exists.

We will be focusing on primary schools in Greater London, and will look at existing and planned major cycling routes, in the context of the GLA (Greater London Authority) plan for reducing carbon emissions, in particular with an expansion on the [Ultra Low Emission Zone](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/ultra_low_emissions_zone_expansion_new) since 25 October 2021. We will also use the accessibility to public transport cscore in the census dataset to add some context.


### 1. Setting up

Download the `Session4-exercise` geopackage from GitHub. It contains the same London data as last week. Drag and drop the `BoroughsCensus` layer and the `Schools` layer onto your canvas. Make sure the CRS is set to `EPSG:27700`.

Pick a basemap of your choice from the `XYZ Tiles` section of your `Browser` panel. I'll be using `CartoDb Positron`.

### 2. Loading OSM layer

Now, we have decided we want to look at cycling lanes in the Greater London Metropolitan Area. We will be using crowdsourced data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about). In order to access this data, we will use the QGIS `QuickOSM` plugin. You can access it through your top menu: `Plugins` > `Manage and Install Plugins...`. Search "quickosm" in your searchbar, install the plugin and close this window.

<img src="../img/S4-02.png" width="700">


Now, to access the plugin, you can either click the icon that appeared in your toolbar, or access it via your top menu: `Vector` > `QuickOSM`.

<img src="../img/S4-03.png" width="700">

This plugin basically enables you to query the (very large!) OpenStreetMap SQL database and load layers of your choice onto your map canvas. You can learn more about what you're querying [at this address](https://docs.3liz.org/QuickOSM/). Today, we will load all the `cycleway` features and we will see later what kind of filtering we might want to do using the values (are they one-way, shared lanes, etc), so leave the `Value` box blank for now.

<img src="../img/S4-04.png" width="700">

Scroll down in the menu (maybe use the vertical scroll bar) and select the spatial extent of your Boroughs layer as the query extent. It means you only want to download cycleways that are within the Greater London boundaries. Press `Run query`.


<img src="../img/S4-05.png" width="700">

After a few seconds to a few minutes, you shold get a success message, a 100% blue prorgess bar, and notice that 4 new layers were loaded onto your canvas. Great! You can now close the query window.

<img src="../img/S4-06.png" width="700">

Note that QuickOSM is a very powerful way for you to get access to feature geometries! However attributes can sometimes be a bit messy or lack consistency (same feature types might be given different names), which may make them tedious to navigate.


Let's have a look at those layers. For cycling lane you would expect to work with lines, however QuickOSM also loaded a point layer. If you double-click the attribute table, you will notice that those points are actually *nodes* and don't contain especially useful attributes. We can't really use this layer to do anything so we will just remove it from our project.

<img src="../img/S4-08.png" width="700">


The polygon layer also doesn't make much sense and only contains a single record.

<img src="../img/S4-10.png" width="700">

 The layer with a single line in it will also not be useful to us. 
 
 <img src="../img/S4-09.png" width="700">

 We will also remove those two layers from our project, and only keep the polyline layer that contains 8296 features.

<img src="../img/S4-11.png" width="700">


**Scratch layer Warning!** 

When you create a new layer using a geoprocessing tool (or in this case the QuickOSM plugin), QGIS will produce a temporary layer, aka "scratch layer". This layer only exists for you in _this_ open session of QGIS and **is not saved anywhere on your computer**. This means unless you do something about it, the layer will be gone next time you reopen this project. Make sure you avoid this rookie mistake by checking that none of your layers display the little hairy box sign. If they do (like in this case, the layers you just queries from OSM) double click and save the layers you want to keep into your project geopackage (give each layer a meaningful name) or as a new shapefile in your project folder. The little hairy box icon will disappear after you save the layer somewhere on your computer.

<img src="../img/S4-07.png" width="700">

In this case, simply save the polyline cycleway layer, and remove the three others from your Layers section if you haven't already.


Now that you've saved your cycleway layer (if you refresh your browser, it should appear in your geopackage), let's move on to the symbology step.


<img src="../img/S4-12.png" width="700">


### 3. Vector symbology

**3.1. Accessing symbology settings**

For any layer, you can double click to open its `Layer properties` menu and navigate to the `Symbology` tab to access all the settings. Start with your `Schools` point layer. In the top dropdown menu you're given a few options.

<img src="../img/S4-13.png" width="700">

These 5 options are common to points, lines and polygons alike (points and polygons have a few additional symbology options of their own):

- **No symbols** = nothing is displayed on the map
- **Single symbol** = all features are displayed the same way
- **Categorized** = features symbols depend on the value of one of their **categorical** attributes (e.g. which type of school, which type of cycling lane)
- **Graduated** = features symbols depend on the value of one of their **numerical** attributes (e.g.length of the cycling lane, population count in a borough, etc)
- **Rule-based** = you can define more advanced nuances using filters and expressions. For instance you could create 3 rules: 1)if a cycling lane is longer than 2km **and** in a separated lane then apply a certain symbology to it, otherwise 2) if it is between 500m and 2km and on a one-way road applly another symbology, and 3) don't display the rest.


**3.2 Point symbology**

Using the single symbol, try to change the opacity, size and colour of your points. Note you can also use presets in the section below.

<img src="../img/S4-14.png" width="700">

Now click on the `Simple Marker` to access further customization options. A few useful ones include the size and colour of stroke, and the shape of your marker. 

<img src="../img/S4-15.png" width="700">

Note that you can even use common logos or import your own SVG or raster symbols to use as markers - for instance here under `Symbol layer type` select `SVG marker` , scroll down and you have access to a large array of logos, including this school logo. You can try it out, notice that it is not the right choice in this case and then please reverse back to a simple marker symbology of size 2mm and grey colour.

<img src="../img/S4-16.png" width="700">


Now that you know more about the symbology customization, let's move on to something more useful for understanding our data. We decide we actually only want to work on primary schools that are currently operational (not closed, not opening in the future). To do so, we want to edit the definition query of our layer so that we only display the open primary school features. Navigate to your `Source` tab, and click `Query builder`. Find out what values are available for different fields. For instance select `STATUS` and click on Sample `All` values. You can double click a field, an operator and a value to directly add them into your expression. Use `Test` to see if your expression has any syntax error.
Write the query that keeps primary schools that are still open, click OK to close this window, click `Apply` in the `Source` tab and go back to your `Symbology` tab.

<img src="../img/S4-17.png" width="700">

We are now interested in displaying the different types of schools in different colours, to see if there is any geographical pattern as to where certain types of schools can be found. To do so, we will use a `Categorized` symbology and pick `TYPE` as our value. 

<img src="../img/S4-18.png" width="700">

Click `Classify` to load the Types values into your legend. Note that you can update your base symbol (click on the `Symbol` dropdown arrow then `Configure symbol`):

<img src="../img/S4-19.png" width="700">


By default, QGIS has a assigned random colours to each point. You can also choose a specific colour ramp from the many available by clicking on the `Color Ramp` dropdown arrow. Because we are using categorical variables here, we prefer to avoid using a sequential palette which would imply some form of order among the values (there is no order here, they're just three different values). 

<img src="../img/S4-20.png" width="700">

You can explore the many options available to you in the colour ramp including shuffling the colours currently assigned to your values, creating your own random colour palette or editing existing ones.

<img src="../img/S4-22.png" width="700">

You can also edit each symbol individually, one by one, by clicking on them directly. You then get access to the same customisation options as you had under `Single symbol` earlier.

<img src="../img/S4-23.png" width="700">


Note that in the Values list, the last value listed is _"all other values"_. You can decide which values you want to keep or remove, and we will just get rid of this one using the red "minus" button.

<img src="../img/S4-21.png" width="700">


There are still quite a few values (you could use [official information](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school) to understand the nuances between each type of school). Here we'd like to improve the legibility of our map by reducing the number of categories. To do so we'll do some "data generalization", meaning we will lump together categories that are quite close thanks to `Rule-based Symbology`.

<img src="../img/S4-31.png" width="700">


The values that were loaded from your `Categorical symbology` are still here. You can either delete them all and start from scratch, or edit the existing ones. We'll start with Academies. Double-click the first value; the epsilon symbol is where you can go to define your expression. Here, we want to create a single categories for Academy converter and Academy Sponsor Led:

<img src="../img/S4-32.png" width="700">

Press OK, then make sure to give a new name to this category (here: `Academies`).

<img src="../img/S4-33.png" width="700">

We also want to touch up the symbology by making the outline gray rather than black. Below, in the symbology section, click the `Simple marker` then scroll down to find the outline colour. Click to select a gray (you can also make it a bit transparent by reducing the opacity). Once you've found the gray you like, click `Copy color`; we'll be re-using it.

<img src="../img/S4-39.png" width="700">

Also change the Size of the marker to **1.6** instead of 2.0, then press OK. You can delete the second row (`Academy Sponsor led`) since we don't need it anymore.


Now let's repeat this process to lump together the two types of Voluntary schools and the Foundation schools. Click on `Foundation School` for example, then find the Epsilon sign and write an `OR` statement to combine these three categories. PRess OK, then don't forget to rename it to `Foundation/Voluntary Schools`:

<img src="../img/S4-37.png" width="700">

Now on the symbology: again, scroll down to edit the `Simple marker`. Change teh size to 1.6, then in the outline colour you can simply paste the colour you used previously!

<img src="../img/S4-40.png" width="700">

You can delete the two extra `Voluntary school` categories so that you are left with only 4 categories:

<img src="../img/S4-38.png" width="700">

Edit the symbols for `Free schools` and `Community Schools` to paste the same outline colour and change the size to 1.6. If the colours are too similar, you can also change them one by one to make sure they're easily distinguishable.


<img src="../img/S4-41.png" width="700">

**3.3 Lines symbology**

Let's now explore the styling of lines. In this case, we have one polyline layer: the OSM cycling lanes layer.

If you open the `Cycleway` attribute table, you will notice that a lot of field are empty and that it's difficult to identify a single field that would make it easy to base our symbology on.

<img src="../img/S4-24.png" width="700">

The `cycleway` field seemed promising, but using the `Summary statistics` tool (PRess `Cmd` + `6`, or go into your menu `View` > `Panels` > `Statistics`) you can see that there are 28 different distinct values in this field.

<img src="../img/S4-25.png" width="700">

Double-click your `Cycleway` layer to open your `Layer properties` and the `Symbology` tab. If we pick a `Categorized` symbology and choose `cycleway` as the Value, we end up with way too many different colours and our map becomes illegible. Would you, as a map reader, be able to understand the values of each line if the Cycleway legend contained 28 items?

<img src="../img/S4-26.png" width="700">

We also can't use `Graduated` symbology _(In fact, QGIS may even crash if you try to use `Graduated` symbology because it doesn't have values to work with)_ because our fields contain `string` values (text), as you can see by clicking in the `Fields` tab :

<img src="../img/S4-27.png" width="700">

In fact, we are now seeing that this layer is going to be very difficult to use.  Let's see if we can find a dataset that's better suited to working with the attribute table. Let's use the reference provider for these questions: we'll use [Transport for London's cycling data](https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/). Download the `CycleRoutes.kml` file to your Session4 working folder (a copy of it is also available in the geopackage on the GitHub). 


<img src="../img/S4-28.png" width="700">

KML files are vector files, you can easily drag and drop the layer onto your map canvas.

<img src="../img/S4-29.png" width="700">

If you look into the layer's attribute table, you'll find that one field is actually quite interesting: 

<img src="../img/S4-30.png" width="700">

**3.4 Polygons symbology**


**3.5 Spatial bookmarks**


Spatial bookmarks

**3.6 Scale-based rendering**

https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/basic_map/symbology.html#moderate-fa-scale-based-visibility

You can also play with scale dependent rendering; using this feature, you control the appearance of your layer at different scales (for instance, you might want some layers to stop being visible when you zoom out of the area to avoid clutter)
